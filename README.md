# Confidential-Escrow WIP!

On my pursuit to learn the confidential transfers extension, I explored deep into the native rust code of the new token-2022 program.
Asked a lot of questions to SamKim - token-2022 core dev on how confidential transfers would work using zk-proofs.

The CPI feature of confidential transfers is still in the works, and not active on devnet (and hence not tested)!
